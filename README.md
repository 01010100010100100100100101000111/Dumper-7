# Fortnite-Dumper-7

Full support for every version from 1.2 (UE4.16) to 11.50 (UE4.24) [Some properties are pending to be added (UWeakObjectProperty etc.)]




Note: When trying to compile in debug-mode you need to comment out the call to ProcessEvent in main.cpp, it always crashes when not in release mode
