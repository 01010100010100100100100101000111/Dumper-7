# Dumper-7 (FProperty-Branch)

SDK-Generator for the latest version of Fortnite (24.00) and UEFN-Editor, should work on some other versions too.

**SDK does not compile**

Notes:
- Make sure to initialize GObjects in the generated SDK by calling InitGObjects()
- This branch won't work with older versions than UE4.25
- Also this branch isn't well tested, so no need to cry when it crashes
*- This branch is even less tested*
