# Dumper 7

SDK Generator for every Fortnite version from [1.2] (UE 4.16) -> [11.50] (UE 4.24) \
and also for some other games like Ark, SOT, BPM, etc.


## Notes

* For some odd reason, you can't call ProcessEvent in Debug Mode, so if you compile in debug just comment out the ProcessEvent call.
* Make sure when you use the sdk to initialize it first by calling `SDK::InitGObjects()`
## Issues
