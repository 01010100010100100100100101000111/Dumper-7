# Dumper-7 (FProperty-Branch)

SDK-Generator for every Fortnite version from 12.00 (UE4.25) to idk where probably (UE4.27)

Notes:
- Comment the ProcessEvent call in Main.cpp when compiling on debug (crashes)
- Make sure to initialize GObjects in the generated SDK by calling InitGObjects()
- This branch won't work with older versions than UE4.25
